This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
options(digits = 3)
cat("hello world!")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
(x = rnorm(40) + 10)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
```

```{r}
(function() {
    if (TRUE) 
        1 + 1  # a boring comment
})()
```


```{r}
names(formals(servr::jekyll))  # arguments of the jekyll() function
```


```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = "red")  # a scatterplot
```
